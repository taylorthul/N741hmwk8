# Homework 8 - DUE April 12, 2017 at 5pm

Please submit Homework 8 as a PDF to CANVAS no later than 5pm EST on April 12, 2017.

## Wisconsin Breast Cancer Data (Original)

For Homework 8 you will be working with the "Original" Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository; see UCI dataset [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Original%29](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Original%29).

The raw data files can be downloaded from the associated Data Folder at [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/). In this homework you will be working with the "breast-cancer-wisconsin.data" dataset, which is a CSV comma delimited file with NO column names in the 1st row. The datafile description and associated column file names are in the "breast-cancer-wisconsin.names" which is a simple text file [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/breast-cancer-wisconsin.names](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/breast-cancer-wisconsin.names). In this text file, as you read through it and scroll down, you'll see the following:

```
7. Attribute Information: (class attribute has been moved to last column)

   #  Attribute                     Domain
   -- -----------------------------------------
   1. Sample code number            id number
   2. Clump Thickness               1 - 10
   3. Uniformity of Cell Size       1 - 10
   4. Uniformity of Cell Shape      1 - 10
   5. Marginal Adhesion             1 - 10
   6. Single Epithelial Cell Size   1 - 10
   7. Bare Nuclei                   1 - 10
   8. Bland Chromatin               1 - 10
   9. Normal Nucleoli               1 - 10
  10. Mitoses                       1 - 10
  11. Class:                        (2 for benign, 4 for malignant)
```

So, the final datafile will have 11 columns. The dataset itself is a compilation of multiple groups of clinical cases also detailed in the breast-cancer-wisconsin.names" file [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/breast-cancer-wisconsin.names](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/breast-cancer-wisconsin.names).

The combined dataset has 699 cases (rows). However, 16 cases were missing values for the "Bare Nuclei" measurement. The R code below, processes the data, applies the names, and removes the cases with missing values. So, the final dataset created below `bcdat` will have 683 cases and 11 variables.

```{r}
# from tidyverse - use readr
# to read in the comma delimited dataset
library(readr)

# raw data does not have column names
bcdat <- read_csv("breast-cancer-wisconsin.data",
                  col_names=FALSE)

# add variable names
names(bcdat) <- c("idnum","clumpthickness","uniformcellsize",
                  "uniformcellshape","marginaladhesion",
                  "singlecellsize","barenuclei","blandchromatin",
                  "normalnucleoli","mitoses","class")

# note in column 7 "Bare Nucleoli" there are
# question marks "?" that need to be set to missing NA
library(dplyr)
bcdat <- bcdat %>%
  mutate(barenucfix = ifelse(barenuclei=="?",NA,
                              as.numeric(barenuclei)))

# keep the main 11 variables
bcdat <- bcdat %>%
  select(idnum,clumpthickness,uniformcellsize,uniformcellshape,
         marginaladhesion,singlecellsize,barenucfix,blandchromatin,  
         normalnucleoli,mitoses,class)

# keep only complete cases, n=683
bcdat <- na.omit(bcdat)
```

## Principal Components Analysis

For this Homework, please refer back to the code and exercises that Dr. Hertzberg presented during lesson 10 - specifically review towards the end of "Lesson10Part3.Rmd" see [https://github.com/vhertzb/Lesson10/blob/master/Lesson10Part3.Rmd](https://github.com/vhertzb/Lesson10/blob/master/Lesson10Part3.Rmd). During this exercise, Dr. Hertzberg introduced you to the `prcomp` procedure for performing principal components analysis. `prcomp` is part of the built-in `stats` package with base R. To learn morn type `help(prcomp)`.

In Dr. Hertzberg's example, she provided code for:

* performing the principal components analysis (pca)
* using the pca output to make a plot of the variances for each principal component (pc)
* computing the PVE (percent variance explained) and plotting the PVE
* and plotting the principal component "scores" of the cases (e.g. the "scores" plot)

I will layout the code below for running the PCA for the dataset as a whole, which will include also making a "loadings" plot for the variable "coefficients" or "loading weights" for each PC - these "loading plots" give us additional insight into (a) how the variables cluster or relate/correlate with each other or not and (b) where they fall in terms of relevance for each PC in the plot. For this dataset, we can easily get away with keeping only 2 PCs and making simplier 2D scatterplots for both the "loading plot" and "scores plot".

Use the code steps below to help you complete this homework 8 assignment.

## 1. Perform the PCA

```{r}
# use only columns 2 through 10
# you do not need the idnum, nor the class variables
pr.out <- prcomp(bcdat[,2:10], scale=TRUE)
summary(pr.out)
```

## 2. Make plots of the variance and PVE 

### Plot of the Variances of Each PC

```{r}
plot(pr.out)
```

### Plot of the PVE and Cumulative PVE of each PC

```{r}
# plots of the PVE percent variance explained
pve = 100*pr.out$sdev^2/sum(pr.out$sdev^2)
pve
plot(pve, type = "o", ylab = "Cumulative PVE", xlab = "Principal Component", col="blue")
plot(cumsum(pve), type = "o", ylab = "Cumulative PVE", xlab = "Principal Component", col="brown3")

```

## 3. Make a "loadings plot" of the variables

```{r}
# loadings are in the "rotation" part of the 
# pr.out list object. "rotation" is a matrix
# with a row for each variable and a column for
# each PC.
pr.out$rotation

# choose the 1st and 2nd columns for the 1st 2 PCs
# and plot these loading weights for the 9
# variables. I tweaked the limits some
# feel free to change these as needed
plot(pr.out$rotation[,1],pr.out$rotation[,2],
     xlim=c(-0.5,0.1),ylim=c(-0.5,1),
     cex=2, pch=19,
     xlab = "Principal Component 1",
     ylab = "Principal Component 2",
     main = "Loadings Plot for PC 1 and 2")


# add xpd=FALSE to prevent lines drawn outside plot area
par(xpd=FALSE)

# add red dashed lines for the axes at y=0 and x=0
abline(h=0, col="red")
abline(v=0, col="red")

# overlay the variable names on this loading plot
text(pr.out$rotation[,1],pr.out$rotation[,2],
     labels = rownames(pr.out$rotation),
     pos = 3)
```

## 4. Scores Plot on 1st 2 PCs

```{r}
# scores plot - use x from the pr.out list object
# plot scores on 1st 2 PCs, columns 1 and 2 of x
# color the points by the "class" variable for
# benign (class=2) or malignant (class=4)
plot(pr.out$x[,1],pr.out$x[,2], 
     col = bcdat$class,
     xlab = "Principal Component 1",
     ylab = "Principal Component 2",
     main = "Scores Plot on PC 1 and 2",
     sub = "Blue=Benign (class=2) and Red=Malignant (class=4)")
```

## Homework 8 Tasks

1. Rerun the PCA (steps 1-4 above) for (A) just the Benign cases and for just the (B) Malignant Cases. The code below, sets up these data subsets for you.

```{r}
# Benign cases
bcdatBenign <- bcdat %>%
  filter(class == 2)

# Malignant cases
bcdatMalignant <- bcdat %>%
  filter(class == 4)
```

_HINT: simply rename the new subsets and run the code steps above._ 

```{r}
# redo for benign ==============
bcdat <- bcdatBenign

#step 1: perform the PCA

pr.out <- prcomp(bcdat[,2:10], scale=TRUE)
summary(pr.out)

#step 2: plots of the variance and PVE
plot(pr.out)

#step 3: make a loading plot of variables
pr.out$rotation

# choose the 1st and 2nd columns for the 1st 2 PCs
# and plot these loading weights for the 9
# variables
plot(pr.out$rotation[,1],pr.out$rotation[,2],
     xlim=c(-0.5,0.1),ylim=c(-0.5,1),
     cex=2, pch=19,
     xlab = "Principal Component 1",
     ylab = "Principal Component 2",
     main = "Loadings Plot for PC 1 and 2 in Benign Class")

# add xpd=FALSE to prevent lines drawn outside plot area
par(xpd=FALSE)

# add red dashed lines for the axes at y=0 and x=0
abline(h=0, col="red")
abline(v=0, col="red")

# overlay the variable names on this loading plot
text(pr.out$rotation[,1],pr.out$rotation[,2],
     labels = rownames(pr.out$rotation),
     pos = 3)

#4: score plot on 1st 2 PCA
# scores plot - use x from the pr.out list object
# plot scores on 1st 2 PCs, columns 1 and 2 of x
plot(pr.out$x[,1],pr.out$x[,2], 
     col = bcdat$class,
     xlab = "Principal Component 1",
     ylab = "Principal Component 2",
     main = "Scores Plot on PC 1 and 2")
```


```{r}
# redo for malignant ==================
bcdat <- bcdatMalignant

#step 1: perform the PCA

pr.out <- prcomp(bcdat[,2:10], scale=TRUE)
summary(pr.out)

#step 2: plots of the variance and PVE
plot(pr.out)

#step 3: make a loading plot of variables
pr.out$rotation

# choose the 1st and 2nd columns for the 1st 2 PCs
# and plot these loading weights for the 9
# variables
plot(pr.out$rotation[,1],pr.out$rotation[,2],
     xlim=c(-0.5,0.1),ylim=c(-0.5,1),
     cex=2, pch=19,
     xlab = "Principal Component 1",
     ylab = "Principal Component 2",
     main = "Loadings Plot for PC 1 and 2 in Malignant Class")

# add xpd=FALSE to prevent lines drawn outside plot area
par(xpd=FALSE)

# add red dashed lines for the axes at y=0 and x=0
abline(h=0, col="red")
abline(v=0, col="red")

# overlay the variable names on this loading plot
text(pr.out$rotation[,1],pr.out$rotation[,2],
     labels = rownames(pr.out$rotation),
     pos = 3)

#4: score plot on 1st 2 PCA
# scores plot - use x from the pr.out list object
# plot scores on 1st 2 PCs, columns 1 and 2 of x
plot(pr.out$x[,1],pr.out$x[,2], 
     col = bcdat$class,
     xlab = "Principal Component 1",
     ylab = "Principal Component 2",
     main = "Scores Plot on PC 1 and 2")
```

2. In the overall dataset, when looking at the loadings plot, which variables cluster together? which variables do not lie with that cluster?
In the loadings plot for the overall data set, the clear outlier is mitoses.  While all the other variables fall within a general cluster, mitoses is far outside it.  Within the cluster there appear to be two sub-clusters of blandchromatin/ barenucfix and uniformecellsize/ uniformcellshape.  

3. How do the variable clusters seen in the loading plots for the Benign data subset and Malignant subset differ? and how are they similar if at all?
Within the Benign subset mitoses is still a clear outlier with the remaining variables falling into a rough group (and three smaller groups within that).  However in the Malignant subset the picture is quite different.  There are two outliers (clumpthickness and barenucfix) and a rough grouping of the remaining variables.  The "group" is far more spread out than in the overall and Benign plots.  

4. Is using 2 principal components reasonable for summarizing the variability seen in this Breast Cancer dataset with 9 measurements? Explain your reasoning for (a) the overall dataset, (b) the Benign subset and (c) the Malignant subset
While utilizing more measurements always gives a more complete picture of the "true" nature of the data, in this case two principal compnents is reasonable for the overall dataset.  In this case a large amount of the proportion of variance is acounted for by PC1 (0.655) there is then a fairly steep drop to PC2 (0.086) so in this case using only two principle components is more usefull than including them all and justifiable as the remainder would not add very much to our understanding.  The same is true when looking at the Benign subset.  Though PC1 does not capture as high a proportion of variance (0.355) as it does when looking at the full dataset, the drop is still steep enough to justify using two. The nearest principle component, PC2, has a proportion of variance of 0.120. Finally, in the Malignant subset the drop between PC1 and PC2 is even smaller.  PC1's proprotion of variance is 0.316 compared to 0.145 of PC2.  This may be a case where we would want to consider using more than two principle components.  

5. While PCA is an unsupervised data analysis method (i.e. no "target" class information is used in the analysis), do you think the 2 PCs extracted do a good job of helping to distinguish Benign cases from Malignant cases (i.e. look back at the overall dataset Scores Plot). Explain your rationale.
Yes I do.  When looking at the overall dataset Scores Plot the classes of Benign and Malignant are clearly distingushiable.  The malignant cases seemed to prodomentaly fall >0 on PC1 and <1 on PC2.  The benign cases were more spread on PC2 but did tend to stay in the negative on PC1.  There is a small amount of overlap, but overall utilizing two priniciple components did differentiate between the two classes.
